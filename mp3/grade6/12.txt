Tom’s family went camping near a lake. They built a tent and cooked dinner together. At night, Tom saw the moon and stars shining in the sky. He listened to the sound of frogs and ducks. In the morning, Tom helped his father catch fish for breakfast. The family enjoyed their trip and felt happy to be together.
