Anna’s favourite animal was the elephant. She read books about elephants and learned many things. One day, Anna visited the zoo and saw a big elephant eating grass. The elephant waved its trunk and smiled at Anna. She took a photo and shared it with her friends. Anna wanted to help animals when she grew up.
