A little duck lived in a big lake. She was afraid of the dark and never swam at night. One evening, her friend the frog said, "Let’s swim together!" The duck was careful but followed the frog. She saw the moon and stars shining on the water. The duck was not afraid anymore and enjoyed swimming at night with her friend.
