A young goat lived on a small farm. He liked to eat grass and play with his friends. One day, the goat saw a big dog near the gate. The goat was afraid, but he remembered his mother’s words: "Be brave and kind." The goat walked slowly to the dog and said hello. The dog smiled and became his friend. The goat learned that being friendly was important.
