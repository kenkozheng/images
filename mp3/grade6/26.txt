Tom’s grandfather told him a story about a clever fox and a silly duck. The fox wanted to catch the duck, but the duck was smart. She hid behind a big rock and waited. The fox looked everywhere but could not find her. The duck ran to the river and swam away. Tom learned that being clever was important.
