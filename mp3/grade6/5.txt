Tom wanted to build a bridge over the river near his home. He asked his grandfather for help. Together, they collected wood and worked hard. After many days, the bridge was finished. Tom’s friends came to see the new bridge. They walked across it and played by the river. Tom was proud of his work and thanked his grandfather for teaching him.
