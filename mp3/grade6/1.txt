Long ago, a clever fox lived near a big forest. The fox liked to play tricks on other animals. One day, he saw a hungry rabbit looking for food. The fox said, "Follow me, I know a place with bread and cake." The rabbit was excited and followed the fox. But the fox led him to a busy road. The rabbit was afraid and stopped. The fox laughed and ran away. The rabbit learned to be careful and not believe everything others say. He found a safe way home and shared his food with his friends.
