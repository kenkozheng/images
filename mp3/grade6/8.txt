Anna and her family went to the beach in July. The weather was sunny and warm. Anna built a big sandcastle and her brother helped. They found shells and played in the water. After lunch, Anna’s mother gave them ice cream. The family watched the sunset and felt happy to be together at the beautiful beach.
