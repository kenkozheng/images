A clever monkey lived in a tree near the river. He liked to eat bananas and watch the boats. One day, the monkey saw a duck swimming in the water. The duck was sad because she lost her way. The monkey called to her, "Come to the tree!" The duck swam to the riverbank, and the monkey helped her find her way home. They became friends and played together every afternoon. The duck was never afraid again with her new friend.
