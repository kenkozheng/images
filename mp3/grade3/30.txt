I look at the stars. Stars are bright at night. I look at the stars from my window before bed. The sky is dark and the stars twinkle like tiny lights. My dad tells me about the moon and the planets. I want to learn more about space. Looking at stars makes me wonder about the universe. Stars are beautiful and far away in the sky.
