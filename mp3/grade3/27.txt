I play soccer. Soccer is my favorite sport. I play soccer with my team on Saturdays. I wear a blue uniform and soccer shoes. I kick the ball hard and run fast on the field. My coach teaches us how to pass and score goals. When we win a game, we all cheer together. Playing soccer keeps me active and strong.
