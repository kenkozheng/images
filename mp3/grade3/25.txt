I brush my teeth. Brushing teeth is important. I brush my teeth in the morning and before bed. My toothbrush is blue and my toothpaste tastes like mint. I brush for two minutes every time. My dentist says my teeth are clean and healthy. Brushing keeps my teeth white and strong. I smile with clean teeth every day and feel good.
