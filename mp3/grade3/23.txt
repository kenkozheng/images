I jump rope. Jumping is good exercise. I jump rope in the playground at school. My jump rope is purple with blue handles. I can jump ten times without stopping. My friends count for me when I jump. Sometimes, we take turns jumping. Jumping rope makes my legs strong and my heart beat fast. It is fun to jump high.
