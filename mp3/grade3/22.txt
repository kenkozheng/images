I eat ice cream. Ice cream is cold and sweet. I like chocolate and vanilla flavors best. My dad buys ice cream for me on hot days. I eat ice cream slowly so it doesn't melt. Sometimes, I share my ice cream with my little brother. We sit together and enjoy the cold treat. Ice cream makes summer days more fun.
