I watch TV. TV shows are fun to watch. I like cartoons about funny animals and superheroes. I watch TV after I finish my homework. My favorite show is on Saturday morning. I sit on the sofa with my snacks and watch the screen. My parents let me watch TV for one hour each day. I enjoy my TV time very much.
