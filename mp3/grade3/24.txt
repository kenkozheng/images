I visit my grandma. Grandma is kind and nice. She lives in a small house with a garden. I visit her every Sunday with my parents. Grandma bakes cookies for me. They are warm and smell good. We sit together and she tells me stories about when she was young. I love visiting my grandma very much. She gives me big hugs.
