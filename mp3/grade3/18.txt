I sing songs. Singing is fun. I like happy songs and songs about animals. I sing at home and at school in music class. My music teacher plays the piano and we all sing together. Sometimes, I sing with my friends at recess. My favorite song is about a rainbow. Singing makes me feel joyful and bright.
